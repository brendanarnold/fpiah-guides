    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <h2>Architecture</h2> 

    <ul>
        <li>The Windows Phone platform is a subset of Silverlight which is itself a subset of the Windows Presentation Foundation. When searching for solutions first try including 'Windows Phone' then try 'Silverlight', then try 'WPF'</li>
        <li>The UI for all of the above is written in 'eXtensible Application Markup Language' (XAML) and the backend is written in either C# or Visual Basic (VB)</li>
        <li>Windows Phone 8 may also be written in Native Code (C++) and HTML/Javascript</li>
        <li>XAML/C# is directly comparable to HTML/Javascript however,
            <ul class="compact">
                <li>XAML/C# are much cleaner languages</li>
                <li>XAML/C# are tailored for the task of writing applications</li>
                <li>HTML/Javascript apps takes less changes to port to another platform</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>.NET is,
            <ul class="compact">
                <li>a huge class library</li>
                <li>the virtual machine that runs compiled C# or VB code</li>
                <li>the name for the platform as a whole</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Visual Studio Express</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio is a development environment optimised for writing C#/VB code</li>
        <li>There is some support for designing XAML pages in Visual Studio but the experience is better in Blend</li>
        <li>Editing XAML code directly is a better experience in Visual Studio</li>
        <li>The main difference between the free Express edition of Visual Studio and the full version is that you cannot install plugins in the Express edition</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Expression Blend</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Expression Blend is a design tool that is optimised for generating XAML</li>
        <li>You can write C#/VB in Blend but the experience is not as good as in Visual Studio</li>
    </ul>
