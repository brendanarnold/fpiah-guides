    <h2 id="tagline">Windows Phone Development for People in a Hurry</h2>

    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <h2>Architecture</h2> 

    <ul>
        <li>There are four options for developing for Window Phone, of which we focus on the latter,
            <ul class="compact">
                <li>HTML/Javascript (introduced in Windows Phone 8)</li>
                <li>Native C++ (introduced in Windows Phone 8)</li>
                <li><a href="glossary.html#xna">XNA platform</a> (for 3D applications)</li>
                <li>Silverlight platform (for 2D applications)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Silverlight Windows Phone platform is a subset of <a href="glossary.html#silverlight">Silverlight</a> which is itself a subset of the <a href="glossary.html#wpf">Windows Presentation Foundation</a>. When searching for solutions first try including 'Windows Phone' then try 'Silverlight', then try 'WPF'</li>
        <li>The UI for all of the above is written in 'eXtensible Application Markup Language' (XAML) which is a diaect of XML and the backend is written in either C# or Visual Basic (VB)</li>
        <li>If you are coming with no knowledge of <a href="glossary.html#vb">VB</a> or <a href="glossary.hml#csharp">C#</a>, opt for C#</li>
        <li>XAML/C# is directly comparable to HTML/Javascript however,
            <ul class="compact">
                <li>XAML/C# are much cleaner languages</li>
                <li>XAML/C# are tailored for the task of writing applications</li>
                <li>HTML/Javascript apps takes less changes to port to another platform</li>
                <li>There is no direct equivelent for CSS although you can save XAML styles and apply them to multiple XAML elements</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Solutions and Projects</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>A Windows Phone app is organised into a 'Solution' and 'Projects'</li>
        <li>A 'Solution' groups together Projects that are associated with your application</li>
        <li>Usually you just have one project in your solution for the app itself, however there may be other projects, for example,
            <ul class="compact">
                <li>unit tests</li>
                <li>a desktop front-end</li>
                <li>a web front-end</li>
                <li>a separate library spun out of the main project</li>
            </ul>
        <li>A Window Phone project generates lots of files automatically, see <a href="project.html">Understanding  Windows Phone Project files</a> for a guide on what they do</li>
        <li><code>.cproj</code> or <code>.vbproj</code> and <code>.sln</code> files are just XML. Take a look inside with a text editor to see that they mostly contain references to other files</li>
    </ul>

            
    <h2>Tools</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio Express is optimised for writing C#/VB code</li>
        <li>Expression Blend is a design tool that is optimised for generating XAML</li>
        <li>There is some support for designing XAML pages in Visual Studio and editing C#/VB code in Blend but the experience is better using both tools for their intended tasks</li>
        <li>Editing XAML code directly is a better experience in Visual Studio</li>
        <li>The main difference between the free Express edition of Visual Studio and the full version is that you cannot install plugins in the Express edition</li>
        <li>The SDK includes a Windows Phone Emulator which is a Virtual Machine running the actual Windows Phone operating System</li>
    </ul>
