    <h1>Silverlight application structure (MVVM)</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>MVVM stands for Model, View, View-Model</li>
      <li>It is a 'pattern' i.e. a coding convention that is not
      enforced but has benefits if you follow it</li>
      <li>You should follow this convention unless you have a good
      reason not to</li>
      <li>The MVVM pattern tells you how to split up and organise you
      code for your application</li>
      <li>It defines three roles for your code, the Model, the View and
      the View-Model</li>
      <li>We usually create a directory in our project for each of these
      roles. Files are orgaised into these directories depending on
      their role</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>View</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The View is code that deals with the UI</li>
      <li>Pages and UserControls (i.e. custom widgets) defined in XAML and their 'code behind files' (i.e. the
      .cs or .vb files that are linked to the .xaml file in the Visual
      Studio project explorer) belong in the view</li>
      <li>In the code-behind files we generally put only code to handle
      UI behaviour (e.g. showing a MessageBox or handling a button
      click) and <em>not</em> code that, for example, saves an object to
      a database</li>
    </ul>
      
    <h2>Model</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The Model is the code that stores the actual data</li>
        <li>Code that retrieves the data from the data source e.g. the
        webserver, database, XML files etc. belongs in the model.</li>
        <li>The classes that contain the data from the datasource e.g.
        the 'Customer' class and the 'Invoices' class, also belong in
        the source</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>View-Model</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The View-Model is a single class
